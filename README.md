# JavaFX_BmiCalculator
Welcome to my GitHub repository for my first BMI calculator built using JavaFX!

This application allows users to input their height in meters and weight in kilograms, and calculates their body mass index (BMI) in real-time. The BMI calculation is then used to categorize the user's weight status as underweight, healthy weight, overweight, or obese.

I had a great time working on this project, and I'm excited to share my code with others who are learning JavaFX. This is a great beginner project that introduces important concepts such as UI design, event handling, and data input validation.

Feel free to explore the code and try out the application for yourself! I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement. #JavaFX #BMICalculator #LearningToCode #ProgrammingJourney
